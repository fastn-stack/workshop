Clicking on this [link](/) will take you to corresponding rendered version
of `index.ftd`. Look at the link/url that we have used here for **/**.

This is a newly created page, and its default URL path is set to `/new-page/` as
per the standard behavior of the `fastn` module. The default URL path generation
in `fastn` is based on the hierarchical structure of the package's folders. In
this case, since the page resides at the root level of the package, it naturally
corresponds to the URL path `/new-page/`. However, if this page were located
within a subfolder, such as `/a/new-page.ftd`, the default URL would mirror the
folder structure, resulting in `/a/new-page/`.

Furthermore, it's important to note that when using `fastn`, the default URL for
an `index.ftd` file within a folder is derived from the folder's name. For
instance, if an `index.ftd` file exists at the path `/a/index.ftd`, its default
URL would be automatically generated as `/a/`.
