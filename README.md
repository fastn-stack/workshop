# `fastn` Workshop

This repository contains the source code of a [`fastn` Hands-On
Workshop](https://fastn.com/workshop/).


> `fastn` is a possible replacement for JavaScript/React to build web
> front-ends. In this workshop you will learn the basics of fastn framework 
> and build a web app.
>
> No prior knowledge of front-end is required.
>
> The workshop is taught by the creators of fastn, and you will learn about the
> motivation and design decisions that shaped fastn as well.
>
> In this hands-on workshop we will go through a series of exercises in stages
> and write code to get the application working. Participants are required to
> have a decent computer, but there is no need to install any software before
> hand (other than your favorite editor).
